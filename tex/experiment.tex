\chapter{The ATLAS experiment at the LHC}
\label{sec:experiment}

The ATLAS detector is one of the two general-purpose experiments 
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.
It has been built to pursue a broad particle physics program. 

The LHC is described in Sec.~\ref{sec:LHC}, while the design and operation of the 
ATLAS detector are discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:ATLAS}.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
\label{sec:LHC}

The LHC~\cite{LHCreport12, *LHCreport3} is a circular $pp$ collider at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.
In addition to protons, also heavy ions can be brought to collision.
The accelerator is located in the tunnel of the dismounted Large Electron-Positron Collider, which has a circumference of 27~km.
Fig.~\ref{fig:lhc} shows a sketch of the LHC and its preaccelerators.
Protons from the ionisation of hydrogen atoms are accelerated to \mbox{$50 \MeV$} in a linear collider~(LINAC2) before entering the Proton Synchrotron
Booster~(BOOSTER).
In the Proton Synchrotron~(PS), the protons gain a total energy of \mbox{$25 \GeV$}.
Finally, they enter the Super Proton Synchrotron~(SPS), in which they gain an energy of \mbox{$450 \GeV$}, which is the nominal injection energy for the LHC.

\end{figure}

Bunches of protons are injected into separate beam pipes in both directions around the LHC ring and are accelerated
with a system of radio cavities to an energy of \mbox{$3.5 \TeV$}, corresponding to \mbox{$\sqrt{s} = 7 \TeV$} (2010~--~2011).
This is roughly 3.5 times more than the highest energies achieved at any other particle collider before.
Superconducting NbTi magnets with a field of up to \mbox{$8.33 \T$} keep the protons on their circular track.
In 2012, the proton energy has been increased to \mbox{$4 \TeV$}, corresponding to \mbox{$\sqrt{s} = 8 \TeV$}.
In the following years, the design centre-of-mass energy of \mbox{$\sqrt{s} = 14 \TeV$} is aimed for.

Each proton bunch consists of about $10^{11}$ particles.
With a minimal bunch spacing of \mbox{$25 \ns$} and a maximum of 2808 bunches, a $pp$ design luminosity of \mbox{$10^{34}\invcms$} can be achieved, 
which results in an average number of more than 20 inelastic collisions per bunch crossing depending on the beam focusing.

In 2011, the largest part of the data was taken with a bunch spacing of \mbox{$50 \ns$}~\cite{fournier}.
With this setting, up to 1380 bunches were circulated.
Luminosities of up to \mbox{$3.65 \cdot 10^{33} \invcms$} were achieved with up to $1.5 \cdot 10^{11}$ protons per bunch.

There are four main experiments at the LHC, which are also depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:lhc}:
ATLAS, which is discussed in more detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:ATLAS}, CMS~\cite{cms}, ALICE~\cite{alice} and LHCb~\cite{lhcb} 
are located at the four interaction points of the two beams.
ATLAS and CMS have been designed to cover a wide variety of physics in $pp$ collisions, ranging from precision tests of the SM to
searches for the Higgs boson and searches for new phenomena.
The design choices for the ALICE detector were guided by the needs of a detector for ion-ion collisions with strong emphasis on the tracking
detectors rather than on calorimetry.
LHCb is a detector optimised for the study of $b$-physics, in particular measurements of CP violation in the $b$-sector.
Since $b\bar{b}$ systems are highly boosted at the LHC, LHCb has an asymmetric design to focus
on the forward region on one side of the $pp$ interaction point.

\section{The ATLAS experiment}
\label{sec:ATLAS}

Fig.~\ref{fig:ATLAS} shows a drawing of the ATLAS detector~\cite{detectorpaper, ATLASTDR} with its solenoid and toroid magnets and the different
subdetector systems.
The subdetectors~--~inner tracking detector, calorimeters and muon spectrometer~--~are briefly described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:ID}~--~\ref{sec:muonspectrometer}.
The magnet, trigger and data acquisition systems are introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:magnets} and~\ref{sec:triggerDAQ}, respectively.

All detector systems have been designed to cope with two main challenges set by the LHC:
on the one hand, the high event rate puts special requirements to the detector.
Fast and radiation-hard electronics and sensor elements are necessary as well as an efficient trigger and data acquisition system.
On the other hand, very good particle identification is the key to an efficient suppression of the large background contribution from multijet
production at a hadron collider, as well as from additional inelastic interactions from the same bunch crossing~(pile-up).

The design of the ATLAS detector follows the structure illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:particlesInDet}, which shows schematically
the interactions of different types of particles with the detector material:
the innermost detector layer is a tracking detector, in which electrically charged particles are traced for example by creating electron-hole pairs
in semiconductors or by ionising gas.
Typically, the tracking detector is embedded in a magnetic field so that the momenta of the particles can be measured from the curvature
of the tracks.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/experiment/particlesInDetector}
\caption[Schematic view of the interactions of particles in a general purpose detector]{
  Schematic view of the interactions of different types of particles in a general purpose detector at a modern high energy particle collider.}
\label{fig:particlesInDet}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The next detector layers consist of electromagnetic~(EM) and hadronic calorimeters.
The calorimeters are massive and therefore induce electromagnetic showers
from electrons and photons by pair production and bremsstrahlung, and hadronic showers by various processes between hadrons and matter.
Electron and photon showers are typically contained
in the electromagnetic calorimeter while hadronic showers range into the hadronic calorimeter.

Since almost all muons produced at the LHC are minimum ionising particles, they are the only electrically charged particles which may pass the
calorimeters and reach the outermost layer, which is made of tracking chambers.
Hence, these detectors are called muon chambers.

In principle, it is desirable to cover the full solid angle with sensitive detector material.
However, in the very forward region some space must be kept open for the beam pipes.
Moreover, support structures, cables, cooling systems etc. need to be included in the detector design and reduce the sensitive volume.

\subsection{Inner detectors}
\label{sec:ID}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.36\textwidth, angle=270]{figures/experiment/InnerDetector}
\includegraphics[width=0.34\textwidth, angle=270]{figures/experiment/InnerDetectorCut}
\caption[Overview of the Inner Detector]{
  Overview of the Inner Detector~\cite{detectorpaper}:
  the left figure shows a longitudinal section of the Inner Detector with the different subdetectors.
  The right figure shows a transverse section and illustrates the distances of the different detector layers from the beam line.}
\label{fig:ID}
\end{figure}

The ATLAS Inner Detector (ID) consists of three subdetector systems:
the Pixel detector and the Semiconductor Tracker~(SCT), which use silicon semiconductor
technology, and the Transition Radiation Tracker~(TRT), which exploits the transition radiation produced in a gas mixture of Xe, CO$_2$ and O$_2$.
Fig.~\ref{fig:ID} shows a longitudinal and a transverse section of the ID.
In particular, the distances of the different subdetector layers from the beam line are illustrated.
The whole ID is embedded in a \mbox{$2 \T$} solenoidal field (Sec.~\ref{sec:magnets}).

With three concentric cylinders~(barrel part) and  three endcap disks, perpendicular to the beam axis, the Pixel detector
covers a range\footnote{ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre
  of the detector and the $z$-axis along the beam pipe. The $x$-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the $y$-axis points
  upwards. Cylindrical coordinates ($r$, $\phi$) are used in the transverse plane, where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The
  pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle $\theta$ as \mbox{$\eta = - \ln \left[ \tan \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \right]$}.} of
\mbox{$|\eta| < 2.5$}.
Each of the 1744 sensors consists of a segmented silicon wafer with pixels of minimum area \mbox{$50 \times 400 \mum^2$} and 46080 readout channels.
The innermost pixel layer, the so-called $b$-layer, is as close to the beam line as \mbox{$50.5 \mm$} and allows for a precise extrapolation of tracks
to the vertices.
This is crucial for any $b$-tagging strategy based on impact parameters and the identification of secondary vertices.

The SCT consists of four layers in the barrel and nine endcap disks.
It covers the range \mbox{$|\eta| < 2.5$}.
The sensors use silicon microstrip technology with a strip pitch of \mbox{$80 \mum$}.
In the barrel, the strips are arranged parallel to the beam line, while in the disks, the strips are oriented radially.
Modules are arranged back-to-back with a small stereo angle of \mbox{$40 \mrad$} to allow for a measurement of the azimuth angle in each layer.
A typical track yields three space-points in the Pixel detector and eight in the SCT.
Together, the silicon trackers ensure the measurement of the track momenta and the identification of primary and secondary vertices.

In the barrel part of the TRT, there are 73 planes of straw tubes filled with gas, which are arranged parallel to the beam axis.
In the endcap, there are 160 straw planes, oriented radially.
The TRT covers a range of \mbox{$|\eta| < 2.0$}, in which the separation of electrons from charged pions is improved by exploiting transition radiation.
Although the TRT does not provide track information in the direction along the beam line, pattern recognition and the measurement of the track momenta
become more robust by using the signals from the TRT.

The total amount of material of the ID is as large as roughly 0.5 electromagnetic radiation
lengths\footnote{The radiation length is defined as the typical amount of material traversed by an electron after which it has lost
$\frac{1}{e}$ of its original energy by bremsstrahlung.}
$X_0$ for \mbox{$|\eta| < 0.6$}.
For \mbox{$0.6 < |\eta| < 1.37$} and \mbox{$1.52 < |\eta| < 2.5$}, the amount of material reaches up to \mbox{$1.5 X_0$}.
In the barrel-to-endcap transition region at \mbox{$1.37 < |\eta| < 1.52$}, the amount of material is even larger.
Electrons and photons in this region were not taken into account in this analysis.
A particular consequence of the sizable amount of material in front of the calorimeters is that a large fraction of photons convert into \mbox{$e^+e^-$}
pairs in the ID volume.

\subsection{Calorimeters}
\label{sec:calorimeter}

Fig.~\ref{fig:calorimeters} shows an overview of the different electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters of the ATLAS detector.
All calorimeters are sampling calorimeters consisting of alternating layers of dense absorber material and active material, where only the active
material is used for the energy measurement.
This design allows for a compact size of the calorimeter system.

The hadronic calorimeter in the barrel~(Tile) uses steel as absorber and scintillators as active material.
All other calorimeters use liquid argon~(LAr) technology with different types of absorbers:
lead in the electromagnetic barrel~(EMB) and the electromagnetic endcap calorimeter (EMEC),
copper in the hadronic endcap calorimeter~(HEC) and the electromagnetic part of the Forward Calorimeter~(FCal),
and tungsten in the hadronic part of the FCal.
The LAr calorimeters are placed in three cryostats: one for the barrel and one for each endcap.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth, angle=270]{figures/experiment/Calorimeters}
\caption[Overview of the calorimeter system]{
  Overview of the calorimeter system~\cite{detectorpaper}:
  the different subdetectors of the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter are shown.}
\label{fig:calorimeters}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The technologies have been chosen to provide fast readout, radiation hardness and high containment of electromagnetic and hadronic showers to ensure
a precise measurement of their energies.
The energy flux is varying in the different detector regions.
Especially in the very forward region, which is covered by the FCal (\mbox{$3.1 < |\eta| < 4.9$}), extremely high fluxes from minimum bias events
drove the design towards dense absorber material and small LAr gaps.

All calorimeters are finely granulated and also segmented longitudinally to allow for a precise determination of the position of the showers and to
distinguish different shower types by the use of shower shapes.
This is particularly important for the central region, which is devoted to precision measurements of electrons and photons:
the EMB (\mbox{$|\eta| < 1.475$}) is segmented into three longitudinal layers, where the first layer, the so-called LAr strips, provide
a very fine granularity in $\eta$ of 0.0031.
To ensure continuous coverage in azimuth and to enable fast readout, the lead absorbers are folded into an accordion shaped structure.

A similar design as for the EMB has been used for the EMEC, which is divided into two wheels covering the ranges \mbox{$1.375 < |\eta| < 2.5$}
and \mbox{$2.5 < |\eta| < 3.2$}.
The inner wheel has a coarser granularity in $\eta$ and $\phi$, limiting the region devoted to precision physics to \mbox{$|\eta| < 2.5$}.
A thin LAr layer (presampler) is placed in front of the EMB and the EMEC for \mbox{$|\eta| < 1.8$} to correct for energy lost in front of the calorimeter.

The Tile calorimeter is located behind the EMB and the EMEC and is divided into three longitudinal layers.
It consists of a central barrel (\mbox{$|\eta| < 1.0$}) and an extended-barrel part (\mbox{$0.8 < |\eta| < 1.7$}).
The radial depth is about 7.4 nuclear interaction
lengths\footnote{The nuclear interaction length $\lambda_I$ for hadrons is defined in analogy to the electromagnetic radiation length $X_0$
for electrons and photons.} ($\lambda_I$).

The HEC is a traditional LAr sampling calorimeter covering the region (\mbox{$1.5 < |\eta| < 3.2$}), which is placed behind the EMEC in the same
cryostat.
It consists of two independent wheels, each of which is divided longitudinally into two parts.

%The design energy resolution for electrons and jets are summarised in Tab.~\ref{tab:designresolution}.
Altogether, the calorimeters cover the range \mbox{$|\eta| < 4.9$} and, thus, provide good hermiticity to ensure also a precise measurement
of the imbalance of the transverse momentum.
Over the whole range in $\eta$, the total thickness of the calorimeter system is approximately \mbox{$10 \lambda_I$}, ensuring good containment of
electromagnetic and hadronic showers and limiting punch-through effects to the muon spectrometer.

\subsection{Muon detectors}
\label{sec:muonspectrometer}

The ATLAS muon system covers the range \mbox{$|\eta| < 2.7$} and is designed to measure the momenta of muons exiting the calorimeter system starting
at energies above \mbox{$\sim 3 \GeV$}.
The tracks of the muons are bent by the magnetic field of the air-core toroid system in the barrel and in the endcaps (Sec.~\ref{sec:magnets}).
The fields in the barrel and in the endcaps are oriented such that muon tracks in both regions are mostly orthogonal to the field lines.

An overview of the different subsystems is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:muons}:
the muon system consists of high-precision tracking chambers as well as trigger systems.
In the barrel part, Monitored Drift Tubes~(MDTs) are used for tracking and Resistive Plate Chambers~(RPCs) for triggering (Sec.~\ref{sec:triggerDAQ}).
In the endcaps, tracking information is provided by Cathode Strip Chambers~(CSCs) and Thin Gap Chambers~(TGCs) are used for triggering.
In the barrel as well as in the endcaps, muons typically cross three longitudinal layers of the muon spectrometer.
The muon system is divided into eight octants with overlaps in $\phi$ to avoid gaps in the detector coverage.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth, angle=270]{figures/experiment/MuonChambers}
\caption[Overview of the muon system]{
  Overview of the muon system~\cite{detectorpaper}:
  the different types of tracking and trigger chambers are shown.}
\label{fig:muons}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The technologies for the tracking systems have been chosen such that high precision can be achieved given the level of the particle flux.
The MDTs in the barrel part follow a robust and reliable detector design.
Since each tube contains only one sense wire, the simple geometry allows for the prediction of deformations as well as for a precise reconstruction.
As the particle flux is increasing with $|\eta|$, the CSCs are more suited for the endcap region:
the higher granularity of the multiwire proportional chambers facilitates to cope with the increasing rates.

The choice of the technologies for the trigger chambers was driven by the requirement for fast and highly efficient trigger capabilities
given the different conditions present in the barrel and endcap regions during data taking.
Additionally, an adequate resolution of the transverse momentum of the tracks was required.
In the barrel, RPCs provide good spatial and time resolution.
In the endcap regions, however, higher particle fluxes as well as the need for a higher granularity required a different
technology: TGCs are used for the region \mbox{$1.05 < |\eta| < 2.4$}.
They are based on the same principle as multiwire proportional chambers and fulfil the needs in terms of rate capability and granularity.
With RPCs and TGCs, a time resolution of \mbox{$15 - 25 \ns$} can be achieved, which is sufficient for fast trigger decisions and a good association of
tracks to bunch crossings.

The benchmark for the tracking performance of the muon spectrometer is set by a 10\% resolution on the transverse momentum of \mbox{$1 \TeV$}
muons~\cite{detectorpaper}.
To achieve this goal, the position of the MDT wires and the CSC strips must be known with a precision better than \mbox{$30 \mum$}.
Therefore, a high-precision optical alignment system was set up to monitor the relative position of the MDT chambers and their internal deformations.

\subsection{Magnet system}
\label{sec:magnets}

The ATLAS magnetic system consists of four large superconducting magnets: a central solenoid and three toroid magnets in the barrel and the
two endcaps.
A sketch of the magnet system is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:magnets}.
The solenoid and the toroids are shown, as well as the tile calorimeter.

The central solenoid provides an axial field with a strength of \mbox{$2 \T$}.
The magnetic flux is returned by the tile calorimeter and its girder structure.
The solenoid was designed to be particularly lightweight and to minimise the amount of material in front of the calorimeter system
to which it contributes only a total of 0.66 electromagnetic radiation lengths.

  }
  \label{fig:triggerdaq}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The toroid systems provide magnetic fields with a bending power of \mbox{$1.5 - 5.5 \Tm$} in the barrel and \mbox{$1 - 7.5 \Tm$} in the endcap regions.
Each system consists of eight air-core coils placed in aluminium housings.
The toroidal fields contain non-uniformities which need to be known to high precision to allow for an accurate measurement of muon momenta.
Hence, 1800 Hall sensors were installed in the muon spectrometer volume to enable the monitoring of the magnetic field.


\subsection{Trigger and data acquisition}
\label{sec:triggerDAQ}

Assuming a bunch spacing of \mbox{$25 \ns$} and approximately 20 inelastic interactions per bunch crossing\footnote{As mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:LHC}, in 2011 most of the data was taken with a bunch-spacing of \mbox{$50 \ns$}.}, the event rate at the ATLAS detector is
of the order of 1~GHz.
A three-level trigger system was set up to reduce this rate to about 200~Hz.
In 2011 data taking, the real trigger rate was indeed of the order of 300~Hz~\cite{fournier}.
The triggers need to suppress minimum bias events very strongly while efficiently selecting rare physics events.
The data acquisition system~(DAQ) gathers the data from the different detector subsystems and buffers them until a trigger decision is received.
When the event is not rejected by one of the trigger levels, the data are recorded permanently.
Fig.~\ref{fig:triggerdaq} shows a sketch of the ATLAS trigger chain indicating the order of magnitude of the trigger rates at the different trigger
levels.

The first trigger level~(L1) is a hardware-based trigger, which reduces the event rate to approximately 75~kHz.
Muons, electrons, photons, jets and hadronically decaying $\tau$-leptons with high transverse momenta are searched for as well as a large momentum
imbalance in the transverse plane and a large total transverse energy.
The muon trigger chambers are used as well as the calorimeter system with reduced granularity.
Within less than \mbox{$2.5 \mus$}, Regions-of-Interest~(RoI) are identified in $\eta$-$\phi$-space, which serve as seeds for the decision at the second
trigger level~(L2).

The high level trigger is composed of the L2 and the Event Filter (EF), both of which are software-based trigger systems.
At L2, the energy and direction of the RoIs are further investigated and also the types of the trigger objects are analysed.
Within \mbox{$40 \ms$} a decision is made, and the event rate is reduced to below 3.5~kHz.
The EF further decreases the rate down to roughly 200~Hz.
Events passing the EF are stored permanently.
The full event information is available at the EF level and, hence, energies and directions of the trigger objects are estimated with higher precision
than at L1 and L2.
In particular, the discrimination between the different particle types is enhanced by the use of the ID tracking system and calorimeter
shower shapes.

Selections of different trigger signatures are collected in so-called trigger menus.
For triggers with very high rates, only a fraction of the triggered events can be selected on a random basis
in order to perform cross-checks and studies of less rare physics processes.
The trigger menus are adjusted to the data taking conditions, in particular to the instantaneous luminosity, in order to make optimal use of the
band width available for storage.

\subsection[Performance in $pp$ collisions]{Performance in \boldmath$pp$ collisions\unboldmath}
\label{sec:performance}

The performance of the different subsystems of the ATLAS detector was studied with the data taken in 2010 and 2011.
Of particular importance is the agreement with Monte Carlo~(MC) simulations (Ch.~\ref{sec:modelling}).

The left plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:IDperformance} shows the invariant mass of $\mu^+\mu^-$ pairs around the mass of the $Z$ boson in \mbox{$0.70 \ifb$} of data,
where the muon momentum was measured using ID tracks only.
An early and an improved version of the alignment of the ID subdetectors were used to measure the distribution (full and open circles,
respectively).
In shaded grey, the expectation from MC simulations is shown.
The width of the reconstructed $Z$ mass distribution is a measure for the ID track momentum resolution.
The resolution in data with improved alignment is generally well reproduced by the MC simulations.
However, the resolution is slightly worse in data, so that the distribution in the MC simulations needs to be broadened to match the
data distribution.

The right plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:IDperformance} shows the estimated resolution of the vertex position in $x$-direction as a function of the squared sum
of the transverse momentum\footnote{The transverse momentum is defined as \mbox{$\pt = p \sin \theta = p / \cosh \eta$}.}
$\pt$ of the tracks associated to the vertex $\sqrt{\sum \pt^2}$ in 1.5 million minimum bias events~\cite{ATLASminbias}.
As expected, the vertex resolution improves with increasing $\sqrt{\sum \pt^2}$.
The general trend of the data is well described by the MC simulations although there are discrepancies in particular for low $\sqrt{\sum \pt^2}$.
The distributions for the resolution in $y$- and $z$-direction show a similar behaviour~\cite{idperformance}.

The left plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:electronperformance} shows the correction to the electron energy scale derived from \mbox{$Z \to ee$},
\mbox{$J/\psi \to ee$} and \mbox{$W \to e\nu$} events with the associated uncertainties for \mbox{$0 < |\eta| < 0.6$} in \mbox{$40 \ipb$} of data.
The measurements for the different processes are consistent within uncertainties and the electron energy scale is known to a level better than 1\%.
For higher $|\eta|$, the uncertainties are slightly larger~\cite{electronperformance}.

The right plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:electronperformance} shows the di-electron invariant mass distribution around the mass of the $Z$ boson in \mbox{$40 \ipb$}
of data and in MC simulations.
The width of the distribution is a measure of the electron resolution.
The MC simulations describe the data well, although the $Z$ mass resolution is slightly narrower in data, which can be corrected for by enlarging
the electron resolution in the simulations.

Fig.~\ref{fig:jetperformance} shows the total uncertainty on the jet energy scale~(JES) as well as different contributions to the uncertainty as a
function of the $\pt$ of the jet.
The left plot shows jets in the region \mbox{$0.3 \leq |\eta| < 0.8$}, the right plot shows jets in the region \mbox{$2.1 \leq |\eta| < 2.8$}.
For the derivation of the uncertainties the data taken in 2010 as well as MC simulations were used.

Contributions to the total JES uncertainty are shown for
the underlying MC model (up-pointing triangles and solid circles),
the noise threshold of the clustering algorithm (down-pointing triangles),
the in-situ calibration using the balance in $\pt$ of dijet events, called $\eta$-intercalibration (crosses and open circles),
the response to single hadrons (open squares), 
and the knowledge of the detector material (full squares).

The total JES uncertainty is of the order of 4\% (6\%) for low-$\pt$ jets in the range \mbox{$0.3 \leq |\eta| < 0.8$} (\mbox{$2.1 \leq |\eta| < 2.8$}) and
decreases to roughly 2\% (2.5\%) for jets with \mbox{$60 \GeV < \pt < 800 \GeV$}.
The uncertainty in the low-$\pt$-region is dominated by MC modelling uncertainties and uncertainties due to the $\eta$-intercalibration.
For higher $\pt$, the JES uncertainty increases again to 4\% (3\%) due to the limited knowledge of the response to high-energetic single
hadrons.

The left plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:muonperformance} shows the invariant di-muon mass around the mass of the $Z$ boson in \mbox{$205 \ipb$} of data.
The expectation from MC simulations is also depicted and shows a slightly narrower distribution than observed in data.

The right plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:muonperformance} shows the width of the distribution around an invariant mass of \mbox{$90 \GeV$} for different regions of
the muon $\eta$.
The resolution is similar for all $\eta$-regions.
Only in the barrel-to-endcap transition regions at \mbox{$1.05 < |\eta| < 1.7$}, the resolution is slightly worse.
The resolution is broader in data than in MC simulations consistently for all $\eta$-regions, which is taken into account by
correcting the muon momentum resolution in the simulations.

  For the derivation of the uncertainties the data taken in 2010 as well as MC simulations were used.

\caption[Muon momentum performance]{
  Performance of the muon momentum measurement in $pp$ collisions~\cite{muonperformanceplots}:
  the left plot shows the invariant di-muon mass around the mass of the $Z$ boson in \mbox{$205 \ipb$} of data together with the expectation
  from MC simulations.
  The right plot shows the width of the distribution around an invariant mass of \mbox{$90 \GeV$} for different regions of the muon pseudorapidity.
  The resolutions measured in data are compared to the resolutions from MC simulations.
