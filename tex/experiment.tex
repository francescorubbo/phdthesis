\chapter{The ATLAS Experiment at the LHC}
\label{sec:experiment}

The Large Hadron Collider is the world's highest energy particle
accelerator, overcoming the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider. The
ATLAS experiment is one of the two multi-purpose experiments that take
advantage of the collisions provided by the Large Hadron Collider, and
has been conceived to pursuit a broad and challenging physics program
including the discovery of the Higgs boson, achieved in
2012~\cite{2012gk,Chatrchyan201230}.

In this chapter we will briefly describe the main features of 
the accelerator (Sec.~\ref{sec:LHC}) and in greater detail 
the ATLAS detector (Sec.~\ref{sec:ATLAS}), both located at the CERN
laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
\label{sec:LHC}

The LHC program~\cite{LHCreport} was approved by the CERN Council in
1994. Work towards the installation of
the most powerful particle accelerator of the world started when the
Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP) was dismantled in 2000 to give
up its place in the tunnel to the LHC, which was then fully
operational by 2008.

The LHC is a circular proton--proton ($pp$) collider consisting of a
27~km ring of superconducting magnets and accelerating cavities, where
two beams of protons circulate in opposite directions. 
The magnets bend and focus the proton beams into a circular trajectory
while radio-frequency cavities boost their energy.
The beams undergo several acceleration steps in the pre-accelerators
chain and in the LHC, which are both part of the CERN accelerator
complex, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lhc}.
Protons from the ionization of hydrogen atoms are first accelerated to
\mbox{$50 \MeV$} in a linear collider~(LINAC2). Then the energy is
increased up to \mbox{$450 \GeV$} through three stages of
synchrotrons: the Proton Synchrotron Booster~(BOOSTER), the Proton
Synchrotron~(PS) and the Super Proton Synchrotron~(SPS).
Finally the protons are injected into the LHC.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/experiment/accelerator_chain}
\caption[CERN Accelerator complex]{
  The CERN accelerator complex. The four main LHC experiments are
  shown at the four interaction points.}
\label{fig:lhc}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The beams are brought to collision in four interaction points along
the ring, where the four main experiments are situated: 
ATLAS, described in Sec.~\ref{sec:ATLAS} and CMS~\cite{cms} are
multipurpose experiments designed to study a broad range of physics
processes; the LHCb~\cite{lhcb} experiment is specialized in the
detection of $b$--hadrons, while the ALICE~\cite{alice} collaboration
focuses on the study of heavy--ion collisions.

An important parameter of the LHC is the {\it
  instantaneous luminosity}  $\mathcal L$, defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lumiN}
\mathcal{L}=f\times n\dfrac{N_1\times N_2}{A},
\end{equation} 
where $f$ is the frequency of collisions, $n$ is the number of
bunches, $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the number of particles in the two
bunches, and $A$ is the beam cross section.
The \textit{integrated luminosity} over a period of time relates the
total number of produced events $N_{tot}$ to the cross section:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intLumi}
\int \mathcal L dt  = \dfrac{N_{tot}}{\sigma}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the integrated luminosity is used to describe the amount of
collision data delivered by the LHC.

First proton beams were circulated on September 10, 2008, with the
plan to have the first collisions at a center-of-mass energy of
$\sqrt{s}=900~\GeV{}$. However, nine days later, a faulty electrical
connection between two superconducting magnets caused the rupture of
the cooling layer and the release of liquid Helium in the insulating
vacuum. The subsequent explosion severely damaged the machine.
After one year of repairs and consolidation, LHC resumed its
operations and finally delivered the first $pp$ collisions on November
30, 2009.
In 2010 each beam was accelerated to an energy of \mbox{$3.5 \TeV$}, 
resulting in $pp$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy
\mbox{$\sqrt{s} = 7 \TeV$}, and an integrated luminosity of about
$45\ipb$ was delivered to the ATLAS and CMS experiments.
In 2011 the LHC delivered about $5\ifb{}$ of $pp$ collision data at \seventev{}.
In 2012, the beam energy was increased to \mbox{$4 \TeV$}, 
corresponding to \mbox{$\sqrt{s} = 8 \TeV$}. An integrated luminosity
of about $23\ifb{}$ was delivered.
The LHC was designed to collide protons up to \mbox{$\sqrt{s} = 14
  \TeV$}. In 2015 the LHC operation will resume with proton collisions
at \mbox{$\sqrt{s} = 13 \TeV$}. 

In the LHC the protons are bunched together into up to 2808 bunches 
with a minimum spacing of \mbox{$25 \ns$}. 
Each bunch consists of about $10^{11}$ particles. 
These parameters will allow in the future to reach 
the design peak luminosity of \mbox{$10^{34}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$}.
However, most of the data collected so far were taken with a bunch 
spacing of \mbox{$50 \ns$} and up to 1308 bunches, yielding a maximum
peak luminosity of \mbox{$3.65\cdot{}10^{33}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$}.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lumivstime}, the peak luminosity has increased
steadily during the data--taking.

\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/experiment/lumivstime}
\caption{
The peak instantaneous luminosity delivered to the ATLAS experiment per day versus
time during the $pp$ runs of 2010, 2011 and 2012.}
\label{fig:lumivstime}
\end{figure}

Due to the high frequency of collisions and charge density of the
bunches necessary to achieve such high luminosity, there is a non-zero
probability that several events, originating from different $pp$ collisions, 
may occur simultaneously.
These {\it pile--up} events are categorized as {\it in--time} or {\it
  out--of--time}. 
In--time pile--up events are caused by  multiple inelastic interactions
of protons in the same bunch collision.
The out--of--time pile--up occurs when the detector records events
originated in different bunch-crossings.
The mean number of interactions per bunch crossing is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:mu}, with an average of about 9 in 2011 and 20 in 2012.

per crossing for the dataset recorded by the ATLAS experiment in 2011 and 2012.}

\section{The ATLAS experiment}
\label{sec:ATLAS}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/experiment/atlas_overview}
\caption[Drawing of the ATLAS detector]{
  Drawing of the ATLAS detector showing the different sub--detectors and
  the magnet systems.}
\label{fig:ATLAS}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) detector is an
experiment~\cite{detectorpaper} designed to discover a wide range of
new phenomena, if kinematically accessible, and to measure the
properties of known particles produced at unprecedented energies and
high rates.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ATLAS}, the detector is built in several
layers of sub--detectors, each devoted to the measurement of different
properties for different types of particles. The sub--detectors are
grouped into three main systems: 

\begin{itemize}
\item The Inner Detector, immersed in
  a solenoidal magnetic field, constitutes a tracking system used to
  identify and measure the momenta of charged particles and to
  identify the interaction vertices and the displaced
  vertices. Sec.~\ref{sec:ID} illustrates the design and operation of
  the inner detector.
\item The Calorimeters are used to identify and measure the energy of
  neutral and charged particles. They are designed to stop most types
  of particles, except for muons and
  neutrinos. Section~\ref{sec:calorimeter} illustrates the design and
  operation of the calorimeter system. 
\item The Muon system is described in
  Sec.~\ref{sec:muonspectrometer}. Because muons minimally interact
  with the other parts of the detector and have long lifetimes, they
  are identified and measured in the outermost detector layer, which
  consists of muon spectrometers immersed in a toroidal magnetic
  field. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coordinate system}
\label{sec:coords}

The ATLAS coordinate system is a cartesian right-handed coordinate
system, with origin at the nominal collision point. The $x$ axis
points toward the center of the LHC ring, the $y$ axis points upward,
and the $z$ axis is along the beam direction. The azimuthal angle
$\phi$ is the angle with respect to the positive $x$ axis in the
$x$--$y$ plane, transverse to the beam direction. The polar angle
$\theta$ is defined as the angle with the positive $z$ axis. The
related quantity pseudo--rapidity, defined as \mbox{$\eta
  =-\ln\left(\tan\theta/2\right)$} is more often used. For
massless objects, this quantity is equivalent to the rapidity as
\mbox{$y =1/2\ln\left((E+p_z)(E-p_z)\right)$}. The
distance in the $\eta$--$\phi$ space is defined as \mbox{$\Delta R
  = \sqrt{(\Delta \eta)^2+(\Delta \phi)^2}$}.

Since the detector is hermetic in the transverse plane, it is useful
to define the transverse component of variables of interest,  
like energy and momentum, as their projection on the XY plane, thus
boost-invariant along the Z axis:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transv}
\et = E\sin\theta, \qquad \pt = p\sin\theta.
	\end{equation}

\subsection{Inner detectors}
\label{sec:ID}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/experiment/innerdet}
\caption[Overview of the Inner Detector]{
  Overview of the Inner Detector: 
  the left figure shows a longitudinal section of the Inner Detector
  with the different sub--detectors.
  The right figure displays a cosmic ray event as recorded by the
  pixel detector.}
\label{fig:ID}
\end{figure}

The ATLAS Inner Detector (ID) consists of three sub--detector systems:
the Pixel detector and the SemiConductor Tracker~(SCT), both of which use
silicon semiconductor technology, and the Transition Radiation
Tracker~(TRT), which exploits the transition radiation produced in a
gas mixture of Xe, CO$_2$ and O$_2$.
Figure~\ref{fig:ID} shows a longitudinal and a transverse section of
the ID. The whole ID is immersed in a \mbox{$2 \T$} solenoidal field
(see Sec.~\ref{sec:magnets}).

With three concentric cylinders~(barrel part), and three end-cap disks
perpendicular to the beam axis, the Pixel detector covers a pseudo--rapidity range of
\mbox{$|\eta| < 2.5$}.
Each of the 1744 sensors consists of a segmented silicon wafer with
pixels of minimum area \mbox{$50 \times 400 \mum^2$} and 46080 readout
channels. The innermost pixel layer, called $b$-layer, is as close to
the beam line as \mbox{$50.5 \mm$} and allows for extrapolation of
tracks to the vertices with precision below \mbox{$100 \mum$}.
Such precision is crucial for the identification of displaced
secondary vertices.

The SCT consists of a barrel with four layers of silicon micro--strip
detectors and two end-caps, each with nine disks. It covers the range
\mbox{$|\eta| < 2.5$}. In the barrel, silicon strips are arranged
parallel to the beam line, while in the disks, the strips are oriented radially.
Modules are arranged back-to-back with a small stereo angle of
\mbox{$40 \mrad$} to allow for a measurement of the azimuth angle in
each layer. A typical track yields three space-points in the Pixel
detector and eight in the SCT. Together, the silicon trackers ensure
the measurement of the track momenta and the identification of primary
and secondary vertices. 

The TRT enhances the momentum resolution by providing additional track
measurement points.
The barrel is made of 73 planes of straw tubes filled with a gas
mixture of 70\% Xe, 27\% CO$_2$ and 3\% $O$. The tubes
are arranged parallel to the beam axis.
In the end-cap, there are 160 straw planes, oriented radially,
covering a range of \mbox{$|\eta| < 2.0$}. 
The TRT also provides stand-alone electron/pion separation based on
the amount of transition radiation, which is much larger for electrons
than for pions.

In order to limit the degradation of the energy measurement in the
calorimeters, the ID is designed to minimize the amount of material in
front of the calorimeters.
The total amount of material of the ID corresponds to roughly 0.5
electromagnetic radiation lengths\footnote{The radiation length is
  defined as the typical amount of material traversed by an electron
  after which it has lost $1/e$ of its original energy by
  bremsstrahlung.} $X_0$ in the range \mbox{$|\eta| < 0.6$}.
In the regions \mbox{$0.6 < |\eta| < 1.37$} and \mbox{$1.52 < |\eta| <
  2.5$}, the amount of material reaches up to \mbox{$1.5 X_0$}.
In the barrel-to-end-cap transition regions at \mbox{$1.37 < |\eta| <
  1.52$}, the amount of material is even larger, with a significant
degradation of the energy measurement in the calorimeters.

\subsection{Calorimeters}
\label{sec:calorimeter}

After crossing the ID and the solenoid magnet, particles enter the
calorimeter system.
The full system is characterized by a coverage in pseudo--rapidity up to
$|\eta|<5$ and an almost full coverage in $\phi$. With  a thickness of
22~$X_0$ and 24~$X_0$ in the barrel and end-cap regions, respectively, 
it is designed to stop most of the particles produced at collisions,
except muons and neutrinos.
Besides the measurement of particle energy, the calorimeters also
provide particle identification information, useful for discrimination
of electrons, photons and jets, and allows the determination
of the missing transverse energy.

Figure~\ref{fig:calorimeters} shows an overview of the different
electromagnetic  and hadronic calorimeters of the ATLAS detector.
Both calorimeters are sampling calorimeters consisting of alternating
layers of dense absorber material and active material.
The absorber is a a dense medium with the purpose of stopping
particles and start showers, while the active material is used for the
energy measurement.

The hadronic calorimeter in the barrel~(Tile) uses steel as absorber
and scintillators as active material.
The electromagnetic and the forward hadronic calorimeters use Liquid
Argon~(LAr) technology with different types of absorbers:
lead in the ElectroMagnetic Barrel~(EMB) and the ElectroMagnetic
End-cap Calorimeter (EMEC), copper in the Hadronic End-cap
Calorimeter~(HEC) and the electromagnetic part of the Forward
Calorimeter~(FCal), and tungsten in the hadronic part of the FCal.
The LAr calorimeters are placed in three cryostats: one for the barrel
and one for each end-cap.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/experiment/calorimeters}
\caption[Overview of the calorimeter system]{
  Overview of the calorimeter system:
  the different sections of the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters are shown.}
\label{fig:calorimeters}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The materials have been chosen to provide fast readout, 
radiation hardness, and high containment of electromagnetic and
hadronic showers\footnote{A shower is a cascade of secondary particles produced 
as the result of a high-energy particle interacting with the dense matter of the calorimeter.} 
to ensure a precise measurement of their energies.

All calorimeters are finely segmented, both transversally and
longitudinally, to allow for a precise determination of the position
of the showers and to distinguish different shower types by the use of
shower shapes. This is particularly important for the central region, 
which is devoted to precision measurements of electrons and photons:
the EMB (\mbox{$|\eta| < 1.475$}) is segmented into three longitudinal
layers, where the first layer granularity is
$\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.0031\times0.098$. 
To ensure continuous coverage in azimuth and to enable fast readout, 
the lead absorbers are folded into an accordion-shaped structure.
A similar design as for the EMB has been used for the EMEC, 
which is divided into two wheels covering the ranges \mbox{$1.375 < |\eta| < 2.5$}
and \mbox{$2.5 < |\eta| < 3.2$}.
The inner wheel has a coarser granularity in $\eta$ and $\phi$, 
limiting the region devoted to precision physics to \mbox{$|\eta| < 2.5$}.
A thin LAr layer (pre-sampler) is placed in front of the EMB and the
EMEC at \mbox{$|\eta| < 1.8$} to correct for energy lost in front of the calorimeter.
The Tile calorimeter is located behind the EMB and the EMEC and is
divided into three longitudinal layers. It consists of a central
barrel (\mbox{$|\eta| < 1.0$}) and an extended-barrel part (\mbox{$0.8
  < |\eta| < 1.7$}). 
The HEC covers the region (\mbox{$1.5 < |\eta| < 3.2$}), which is
placed behind the EMEC in the same cryostat. It consists of two
independent wheels, each of which is divided longitudinally into two
parts. 

Altogether, the calorimeters cover the range \mbox{$|\eta| < 4.9$},
thus providing enough hermeticity to ensure a precise measurement
of the imbalance of the transverse momentum.
Over the whole range in $\eta$, the total thickness of the calorimeter
system ensures a good containment of
electromagnetic and hadronic showers and limits punch-through effects to the muon spectrometer.

\subsection{Muon detectors}
\label{sec:muonspectrometer}

The ATLAS muon system covers the range \mbox{$|\eta| < 2.7$} and is
designed to measure the momenta of muons with energy above \mbox{$\sim
  3 \GeV$}. 
The tracks of the muons are bent by the toroidal magnetic field (see
Sec.~\ref{sec:magnets}), whose orientation is such that muon tracks in
both barrel and end-caps are mostly orthogonal to the field lines.

The muon system, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:muons}, consists of
high-precision tracking chambers as well as trigger systems.
In the barrel part, Monitored Drift Tubes~(MDTs) are used for tracking
and Resistive Plate Chambers~(RPCs) for triggering.
In the end-caps, tracking information is provided by Cathode Strip
Chambers~(CSCs), and Thin Gap Chambers~(TGCs) are used for
triggering.
In the barrel as well as in the end-caps, muons typically cross three
longitudinal layers of the muon spectrometer.
The muon system is divided into eight octants with overlaps in $\phi$
to avoid gaps in the detector coverage.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/experiment/muonchambers}
\caption[Overview of the muon system]{
  Overview of the muon system:
  the different types of tracking and trigger chambers are shown.}
\label{fig:muons}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The technologies for the tracking systems have been chosen according to
the expected particle flux.
The MDTs in the barrel part follow a robust and reliable detector design.
Since each tube contains only one sense wire, the simple geometry
allows for the prediction of deformations as well as for a precise
reconstruction.
As the particle flux increases with $|\eta|$, the CSCs are more suited
for the end-cap region: the higher granularity of the multi-wire
proportional chambers facilitates to cope with the increasing rates. 

The choice of the technologies for the trigger chambers was driven 
by the requirement for fast and highly efficient trigger capabilities
given the different conditions present in the barrel and end-cap
regions during data taking. 
Additionally, an adequate resolution of the transverse momentum of the
tracks was required. 
In the barrel, RPCs provide good spatial and time resolution.
However, in the region \mbox{$1.05 < |\eta| < 2.4$}  the particle flux
is higher and TGCs, with higher granularity, are used.
With RPCs and TGCs, a time resolution of \mbox{$15 - 25 \ns$} can be
achieved, 
which is sufficient for fast trigger decisions and a good association of
tracks to bunch crossings.

\subsection{Magnet system}
\label{sec:magnets}

The ATLAS magnets system consists of four superconducting
magnets: a central solenoid and three toroidal magnets in the barrel and the
two end-caps (see Fig.~\ref{fig:magnets}).

The central solenoid provides an axial field with a strength of \mbox{$2 \T$}.
The solenoid was designed to be particularly lightweight and to
minimize the amount of material in front of the calorimeter system.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/experiment/magnets}
\caption[Overview of the magnet system]{
  Overview of the magnet system:
  the solenoid and the toroids are shown.}
\label{fig:magnets}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The toroids system provides magnetic fields with a bending power
of \mbox{$1.5 - 5.5 \Tm$} in the barrel and \mbox{$1 - 7.5 \Tm$} in the end-cap regions.
Each system consists of eight coils placed in aluminum housings.
The toroidal fields contain non-uniformities which need to be known to
high precision to allow for an accurate measurement of muon momenta.
Hence, 1800 Hall sensors were installed in the muon spectrometer 
volume to enable the monitoring of the magnetic field.

\subsection{Forward sub--detectors}
\label{sec:forward}

ATLAS is equipped with sub--detectors in the forward regions used for
monitoring tasks.
The Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators (MBTS), embedded in the
structure of TileCal extended barrel modules, consist of 32 scintillator
paddles assembled in two disks covering the pseudo--rapidity region
$2.09<|\eta|<3.84$ and are used to detect minimum bias activity and to
indirectly measure the luminosity.

Two other systems are specifically designed to determine the
luminosity delivered to ATLAS: LUCID and ALFA.
LUCID (LUminosity measurements using Cerenkov Integrating Detector)
consists of 32 gas-filled tubes surrounding the beam pipe at 17~m from
the interaction point on both sides of ATLAS and measures the
luminosity bunch by bunch. 
ALFA (Absolute Luminosity For ATLAS) is used to calibrate the
luminosity measurement with dedicated runs, and consists of 8
scintillating fibers placed at 240~m from the interaction point inside
roman pots, above and below the beam pipe.
Auxiliary monitoring of the luminosity is provided by the Zero-Degree
Calorimeter, whose main purpose is to determine the centrality of heavy-ion
collisions.
Placed at 140~m from the interaction point on both sides of the beam axis,
it is made of quartz rods alternated with tungsten plates.

The Beam Condition Monitor (BCM) consists of two sets of
diamond sensors located 184~cm from the interaction point along the
beam and at a radial distance of $R=$5.5~cm. 
It is devoted to the detection of beam losses and provides fast
signals to abort the beam safely, in case the loss rate becomes dangerous
for the integrity of the ATLAS detector.

\subsection{Trigger system}
\label{sec:triggerDAQ}

With a nominal bunch spacing of \mbox{$50 \ns$} and
$\approx{}1$ MB event size, ATLAS generates more
information than can be recorded to disk. In 20 million 
interactions per second, approximately one \ttbar{} event 
is produced. It is therefore crucial to have an efficient trigger
system for selecting events of interest.

The ATLAS trigger system, shown schematically in
Fig.~\ref{fig:trigger}, has a three tier structure with increasing
levels of information used in reconstruction, and hence refinement of
the selection criteria, at each stage.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/experiment/trigger}
\caption[ATLAS trigger system]{
  Schematic diagram of the ATLAS trigger system~\cite{trigger}. }
\label{fig:trigger}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

At the first stage, Level 1 (L1), hardware triggers use coarse
calorimeter and muon information for the trigger decision. At this
level the event accept rate is reduced to a maximum of 75 kHz with a
latency on decision of $\approx{}25\mus{}$. In the cases where the
trigger is passed, the raw event data are sent to the readout stream
for the next trigger level. The L1 trigger defines one or more
\emph{regions-of-interest} (RoIs) in $\eta{}$ and $\phi{}$ where the
L1 trigger has identified interesting features. 

The Level 2 (L2) trigger is based on software. At this level the full detector
granularity is used for the trigger decision but only within the RoIs
identified at L1. Thus the throughput is reduced to
$\approx{}2~\mathrm{kHz}$ within the allowed latency of $\approx{}40\ms{}$.

The final trigger level is the Event Filter (EF). At this stage the RoIs
information is processed using the same algorithms as the off-line
reconstruction. The EF reduces the output rate to $\approx{}200~\mathrm{Hz}$, 
with a latency of $\approx{}4\sec{}$. Once accepted by an EF trigger, an
event is written to mass storage.
The combination of the two software steps L2 and EF is referred to 
as High Level Trigger (HLT).

During the course of 2011 the RoI--seeded approach at the EF was replaced by a
{\it full-scan} strategy. It was found that sufficient time was available
to read the information from the entire ATLAS calorimetry system, 
which allows to improve the on-line selection efficiency.

\subsubsection{The trigger menu}

The trigger system is configured via a trigger \textit{menu} which
defines trigger \textit{chains}.
Each \textit{chain} is defined by a sequence of steps at each trigger level.
Thresholds are increasingly tightened at each level in order to
maximize selection efficiencies. 
For each HLT level, a sequence of read-out, reconstruction and
selection steps is specified. 
A trigger is defined as the combination of the L1 seeding item and the
two HLT (L2 and EF) chains. 

Triggers are categorized based on the object reconstructed (jets,
muons, etc..), and the selection requirements, such as energy
thresholds, multiplicity or isolation. This categorization, together
with other distinctions, depending on the reconstruction algorithm and
its configuration, are encoded in the trigger name.
The naming convention is as follow:
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:}
{\rm [LEVEL][N][TYPE(S)][THRESHOLD][ISOLATION][QUALITY]},
\end{equation*}
where the components, from left to right, are: the trigger level used, the
multiplicity of the type, the object candidate, the threshold applied to
the transverse momentum or energy of the object candidate, the object
isolation, and additional requirements related to the type of algorithm used.

In order to keep the rate within the available bandwidth
($\approx{}200~\mathrm{Hz}$),  prescales are applied to the triggers
with loose requirements so that only a fraction of the events passing
the selection are actually recorded.
Prescales are dynamically adjusted as the instantaneous luminosity
decreases at each collision. Data--taking time units are defined as
{\it Luminosity Blocks} (LB), corresponding to few minutes of  data
taking, with associated information on beam conditions, detector performance 
and trigger configuration. All the LB between the start and the
end of a stable beam collision period constitute a {\it run}. Runs are grouped
in {\it Data Periods}, labelled with capital letters (Period A, Period B, {\it etc}.),
which correspond to the same general detector conditions, machine configuration and
trigger menu.

\subsection{Data quality requirements}
\label{sec:daq}

Not all collision events recorded by ATLAS are used for data analysis.
Each sub--detectors maintains a record of its performance across the
run. Only the data collected with sub--detectors meeting quality
requirements are considered for the analysis. Therefore, for each dataset
{\it Good Runs Lists} (GRL) are compiled recording for each LB which
sub--detectors satisfied the requirements.
For the measurements presented in this dissertation, all ATLAS sub--systems
are needed as the physics objects used in the analyses are reconstructed
using the information from the full detector. The typical data quality
efficiency is well above 90\%.
