In this section a detailed comparison between data and predictions is
shown as a further validation of the background and signal modeling. The
distributions of basic kinematic quantities of the reconstructed
objects are considered, such as $\pt{}$ and $\eta$ of lepton or jets,
\met{} and \mtw{}. The distributions corresponding to the dataset at
\seventev{} are shown in
Figs.~\ref{fig:2011mu_pretag}--\ref{fig:2011ele_tagged}, while the ones
at \eighttev{} are shown in
Figs.~\ref{fig:2012mu_pretag}--\ref{fig:2012ele_2tag}.
