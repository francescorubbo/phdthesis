Measurements of the asymmetry in the production of top quark pairs at
the ATLAS experiment have been performed, using a dataset
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $4.7 \ifb{}$ taken over
the course of 2011 at a centre-of-mass energy \seventev{} and a
dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $20 \ifb{}$
taken over the course of 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy \eighttev{}.
This represents the full dataset collected by ATLAS over the course of
LHC Run 1.

The lepton+jets signature of the semileptonic \ttbar{} decay has been
exploited to select samples enriched in \ttbar{} events by identifying
and reconstructing one isolated lepton with large transverse momentum,
at least four jets and a large missing transverse momentum.
The background contamination of the sample has been studied and
data-driven techniques have been developed to precisely determine its
composition. In particular, the normalization of the different
$W$+heavy--flavor processes has been determined in--situ exploiting
the intrinsic charge asymmetry in $W$ production at LHC. 
Other background processes, such
as single top, Z+jets and diboson production have been estimated with
Monte Carlo simulations, while QCD multijet events have been modeled
with well established data-driven techniques.
The four momenta of the \ttbar{} pair has been reconstructed
event--by--event with a kinematic fit of the measured objects. The
inclusive and differential distribution of the difference of absolute
rapidities of the reconstructed top and antitop quarks, \dy{}, has then been
measured in data and estimated for the backgrounds.
A novel unfolding procedure, based on a bayesian inference approach, has
been performed to estimate the inclusive and differential \dy{}
distribution, and the corresponding asymmetries, at the parton--level,
accounting for the distortions induced by acceptance and
resolution effects.
The procedure has been calibrated with the goal of obtaining the most
precise and accurate achievable asymmetry measurement, by studying the
response in distributions for which the corresponding parton--level
asymmetry is known.

In the \seventev{} dataset, the asymmetry \ac{} has been measured
inclusively and differentially as a function of \mtt{}, \pttt{} and \ytt{}, and has been found
to be compatible with the SM predictions in all cases. The inclusive
measurement and the one as a function of \mtt{} have also been performed in
a $\qqbar{}\to\ttbar{}$ enriched sample ($\betatt{}>0.6$), yielding
SM--compatible results as well. The precision of both inclusive and
differential measurements is limited by the statistical uncertainty,
while the largest systematic uncertainties are the ones with a large
impact on the acceptance for asymmetric backgrounds (\wjets{} and
single top production), such as the uncertainty on the energy scale and
resolution of jets and leptons.
In the \eighttev{} dataset, the asymmetry \ac{} has been measured
inclusively and differentially as a function of \mtt{}; in both cases the results are
compatible with the SM predictions. The set of measurements will be
completed to match the \seventev{} set, with the differential
measurement as a function of \pttt{} and measurements in the
\qqbar{}--enriched sample with $\betatt{}>0.6$.
Both sets of measurements are the most precise to date at the LHC,
reaching an absolute precision of 0.6\% in the case of the inclusive measurement
at \eighttev{}. The high precision is necessary in order to have
sensitivity to the small deviations expected from new physics effects.
At this stage the asymmetry measurements at LHC do not show
significant deviations from the SM predictions, although they are also
consistent with new physics scenarios that explain the Tevatron
anomaly and the SM--like \ac{} measurements at the LHC.

The precision of these measurements will be critical to significantly
constrain possible models of new physics that would be consistent with
the excess at the Tevatron and the lack of a significant deviation at
the LHC. A combination of ATLAS and CMS results has been performed at
\seventev{}, where this measurement drives the overall precision. A
combination of measurements from ATLAS and CMS is also foreseen for
the results at \eighttev{}.
Due to the different initial state and subsequently different
asymmetry definitions, a direct comparison with the anomaly reported
at Tevatron cannot be performed. One important step would be to
simultaneously measure the dependence of the asymmetries on the
\ttbar{} invariant mass \mtt{} and velocity \betatt{}, in order to
extrapolate the 'collider-independent' asymmetries $A_u$ and
$A_d$~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2012va}. This measurement is quite
demanding from the experimental side, since it requires a
3--dimensional unfolding in \mtt{}, \betatt{} and \dy{}. But it offers
a unique possibility of testing at LHC the same quantities that are at
the origin of the Tevatron \afb{}.
The experimental strategy used for this analysis, including the
unfolding technique, appears promising to perform such extension of
the analysis, although detailed studies still need to be performed.

Measuring the asymmetry \ac{} as an effective probe for new physics in
future LHC datasets will become more challenging. Proton collisions
will be delivered at higher center-of-mass energy -- $13\TeV{}$ in
2015 -- thus making the fraction of $\qqbar{}\to\ttbar{}$ events even
smaller. Beside enhancing the \qqbar{} fraction by requiring a large
$z$--component of the \ttbar{} velocity, a promising approach is to
study the asymmetry in \ttbar{} events produced in association with
photons~\cite{Aguilar-Saavedra:2014vta}.
