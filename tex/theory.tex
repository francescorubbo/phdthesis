\chapter{Theoretical Framework}
\label{sec:theory}

The theoretical framework describing the subatomic world has
evolved dramatically during the course of the past century with the
formulation of the Standard Model of particle physics in the
1960's. The theory has been very successful at describing known
phenomena and at predicting new ones that have found experimental
confirmation, the most recent being the observation of the Higgs boson
at the Large Hadron Collider in July 2012.

This chapter reviews the formulation of the Standard Model, focusing
on the physics of the top quark, relevant for this dissertation. In
Sec.~\ref{sec:theSM} the fundamental particles and interactions
described by the Standard Model are introduced. The phenomenology of
the one particle studied in this dissertation, the top quark, is
detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:topquark}, while Sec.~\ref{sec:topca}
reviews the theoretical and experimental status of asymmetry measurements
in top quark pair production.


\section{The Standard Model}
\label{sec:theSM}

The Standard Model (SM) is a quantum field theory describing the
interactions between the elementary constituents of matter through the
fundamental forces.
The matter particles -- three {\it leptons}, three {\it neutrinos} and six
{\it quarks} -- are fermions categorized in three families. For each particle
there exists an antiparticle with the same mass and opposite quantum
numbers for a total of 24 matter particles.
They all carry a weak charge and interact with
the weak force carriers $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$. All matter particles, except for
neutrinos, are electrically charged and interact with the
electromagnetic force, mediated by the photon. Only the quarks have a
color charge and undergo strong force interactions with {\it gluons}.  
Table~\ref{tab:smparticles} shows the elementary particles of the
Standard Model, classified as matter particles and force carriers.

  \label{tab:smparticles}
\end{table}

The theory describing the particle interactions is structured
according to the gauge group $SU(3)_C\times{}SU(2)_L\times{}U(1)_Y$. The three
terms represent the fundamental symmetries corresponding to the forces describing the
interaction of particles: $SU(3)_C$ is the {\it color} ($C$) symmetry;
$SU(2)_L\times{}U(1)_Y$ is the symmetry with respect to the {\it
  isospin} ($L$) and {\it hypercharge} ($Y$) gauge groups.
The SM is then the combination of two theories: the {\it Quantum
  Chromodynamics} (QCD) lagrangian, which describes the strong
interaction arising from the $SU(3)$ color symmetry, and the {\it
  Electroweak} lagrangian, which accounts for the electroweak
interactions corresponding to the $SU(2)\times{}U(1)$ isospin and
hypercharge symmetries:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\lagr{}_{SM}  & = \lagr{}_{SU(3)} + \lagr{}_{SU(2)\times{}U(1)} \\
& = \lagr{}_{SU(3)}^{Gauge} 
+ \lagr{}_{SU(2)\times{}U(1)}^{Gauge} 
+ \lagr{}_{SU(3)}^{Matter}
+ \lagr{}_{SU(2)\times{}U(1)}^{Matter}
+ \lagr{}_{SU(2)\times{}U(1)}^{Higgs} +
\lagr{}_{SU(2)\times{}U(1)}^{Yukawa}. \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The $\lagr{}^{Gauge}$ terms describe the dynamics of the gauge fields:
the gluons in QCD, and the $W$, $Z$ and $\gamma$ boson in the
electroweak theory.
For the strong gauge interaction, relevant for the subject of this
dissertation, the gauge term is given by
\begin{equation}
\lagr{}_{SU(3)}^{Gauge} = \frac{1}{2g_S^2}\mathrm{Tr}G^{\mu\nu}G_{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where $G^{\mu\nu}$ is the gluon field strength tensor and $g_s$ is the
strong gauge coupling constant.
The $\lagr{}^{Matter}$ terms describe the interaction of particles
with the gauge fields. The matter term of the QCD lagrangian contains
the covariant derivatives $\slashed{D}$ of the quark fields $q$:
\begin{equation}
\lagr{}_{SU(3)}^{Matter}=i\bar{q}_\alpha \slashed{D}^\alpha_\beta
q^\beta ,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$,$\beta$ are the quark color indices, and $\slashed{D}$
introduces the gauge interaction with the gluon field $G_\mu$ as
\begin{equation}
\slashed{D}_\mu = \partial_\mu \delta^\alpha_\beta + ig_sG_{\mu
  \beta}^\alpha .
\end{equation}
A similar structure defines the electroweak terms.
The $\lagr{}^{Higgs}$ and $\lagr{}^{Yukawa}$ terms arise from the
spontaneous symmetry breaking of the $SU(2)\times{}U(1)$ gauge theory
via the Higgs mechanism, and they are responsible, respectively, for
the interaction of the Higgs field with the other particles and force
carriers, and for generating their masses.
The Higgs field, whose corresponding boson has been discovered at the
LHC in 2012~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa},
needs to be introduced in
the $SU(2)\times{}U(1)$ theory in order to account for the
non-vanishing masses of $W$ and $Z$ bosons and of lepton and quarks.
The Higgs boson does not interact with the gluon and the photon;
therefore they are the only two massless particles of the
SM. Table~\ref{tab:smmasses} summarizes the masses of the SM particles.

\section{The top quark}
\label{sec:topquark}

The top quark was discovered in 1995 at the Tevatron by the
CDF~\cite{topcdf} and \dzero{}~\cite{topdzero} Collaborations. With a
mass of $\approx{}170\GeV{}$, it is the heaviest elementary particle
observed so far. Its proximity to the electroweak scale suggests that
the top quark might play a relevant role in new physics
scenarios. Therefore its production, decay modes and properties have
been studied in detail at the two hadron colliders powerful 
enough to produce it: the Tevatron, where protons and antiprotons (\ppbar{}) were
collided till September 2011, and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
colliding protons since February 2010.

\subsection{Top quark production at hadron colliders}
\label{sec:topprod}

At hadron colliders, top quarks are mainly produced in pairs
(\ttbar{}) via the strong interaction, while they can also be produced
singly ({\it single top}) via the electroweak interaction at about
half of the \ttbar{} production rate. In the following, the production
of \ttbar{} pairs is discussed. The constituent partons of the
colliding hadrons (protons or antiprotons) participate in a hard
scattering process and produce a top quark and an antitop quark. The
leading production modes are: {\it gluon--gluon fusion} and {\it
  quark--antiquark annihilation}. The leading order Feynman diagrams
for these two processes are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ttbarprod}. The
following discussion focuses on the \ttbar{} production in proton
collisions; however similar considerations apply to the case of
proton-antiproton collisions.

\begin{figure}[!htb]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/theory/ttbarprod}
  \caption{Leading order diagrams for QCD top quark pair production.
    Gluon fusion, {\tt a)} and {\tt b)}, and  quark--antiquark
    annihilation, {\tt c)}.}
  \label{fig:ttbarprod}
\end{figure}

Due to the composite nature of the proton, most of the
collisions involve only soft (i.e. long--distance) interactions of the
constituent quarks and gluons. Such interactions cannot be described
with perturbative QCD because the expansion parameter $\alpha_s$ is
large for small momentum exchange.
In some collisions, however, in addition to the long distance parton
interactions, two quarks or two gluons undergo a hard
(i.e. short--distance) scattering where a top quark pair is produced.
The {\it factorization theorem}~\cite{factorprinciple} states that
the perturbative QCD description of this hard process is possible by
factorizing the long--distance effects into functions $f$ describing the
proton structure. Thus the cross section for top quark pair
production in a collision of two protons with momenta $P_1$ and $P_2$
is given by:\par\noindent
{\small
\begin{equation}
  \sigma(p(P_1)+p(P_2)\to\ttbar{}+{\rm X})
  = 
  \sum_{a,b}
  ~\int_0^1{\rm d}x_1
  ~\int_0^1{\rm d}x_2
  ~ f_a(x_a,\factscale{})~f_b(x_b,\factscale)
  ~\hat{\sigma}_{ab\to\ttbar{}+\rm{X}}(x_1P_1,x_2P_2,\renormscale{},\factscale{}),
  \label{eq:ttbarxs}
\end{equation}
}\par\noindent
where the sum runs over all type of partons, $x_{1,2}$ are the
fractions of proton momentum carried by the constituents participating
in the hard interaction, and $\hat{\sigma}_{ab\to\ttbar{}+\rm{X}}$ is
  the partonic cross section. 
The {\it parton distribution functions} (PDFs) $f_a(x,\factscale{})$
represent the probability density for a parton of type $i$ to carry
a fraction of proton momentum $x$. The {\it factorization scale}
\factscale{} is set arbitrarily and defines the distinction between
short-- and long--distance interactions based on the transferred
momentum $Q^2$. An additional renormalization scale \renormscale{}
accounts for higher--order corrections. For calculations and
simulations, both scales are set to the typical transferred momentum $Q^2$
of the process studied. In the case of \ttbar{} production the scale
is often chosen to be equal to the top quark mass,
$\factscale{}=\renormscale{}=m_t^2$.
  
The PDFs cannot be computed in perturbation theory; instead, they are
measured in deep--inelastic scattering experiments and at hadron colliders.
For the studies presented in this thesis, the PDF estimations
provided by the CTEQ~\cite{cteq6}, MRST~\cite{mrst}, MSTW~\cite{mstw},
CT10~\cite{ct10} and NNPDF~\cite{nnpdf} collaborations are
used. Figure~\ref{fig:pdfs} shows the PDFs of valence quarks, gluons and
sea quarks for two values of transferred momentum $Q^2$ at which the
proton is probed. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/theory/mstw2008nnlo68cl_allpdfs}
  \caption{MSTW parton distribution functions~\cite{ct10} for gluons
    and quarks at $Q^2=10\GeV{}^2$ (left) and $Q^2=10^4\GeV{}^2$ (right).}
  \label{fig:pdfs}
\end{figure}

The typical fraction of momentum $x$ carried by each of the colliding
partons in order to produce a top quark pair is defined by the
relationship
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{x_1x_2s}\geq{}2m_t.
\end{equation}
Therefore, assuming both colliding partons carry a similar fraction of momentum
$x_1\simeq{}x_2\simeq{}x$:
\begin{equation}
x=\frac{2m_t}{\sqrt{s}}
.
\end{equation}
This corresponds to a typical value of $x\approx{}0.05$ at the LHC for
a center-of-mass energy \seventev{} and \eighttev{}. As shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:pdfs}, the probability of gluon collisions is
significantly larger than for any other parton in the corresponding
range of $x$. Thus the production of top quark pairs at the LHC is
dominated by the gluon fusion process ($\approx{}85\%$). On the
contrary, at the Tevatron, the typical value of $x\approx{}0.2$ makes
the valence quark-antiquark annihilation the prevalent \ttbar{}
production mode.

The total \ttbar{} production cross section at the LHC is calculated
at next-to-next-to leading order in
QCD to be
$\sigma_{\ttbar{}}=177.31^{+10.1}_{-10.8}$ pb at \seventev{} and
$\sigma_{\ttbar{}}=252.89^{+13.30}_{-14.52}$ pb at \eighttev{}, for a top quark mass of
$172.5 \GeV{}$~\cite{ttxs1,ttxs2,ttxs3,ttxs4,ttxs5,ttxs6,ttxs7}.
 Measurements have been performed by both ATLAS and CMS
collaborations, yielding a combined value of $\sigma_{\ttbar{}}=173.3\pm10.1$ pb at
\seventev{}~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2012-134,CMS-PAS-TOP-12-003}. Preliminary
measurements at \eighttev{} yield $\sigma_{\ttbar{}}=242\pm{}9$ pb
(ATLAS)~\cite{Aad:2014kva} and $\sigma_{\ttbar{}}=239\pm{}13$ pb
(CMS)~\cite{Chatrchyan:2013faa}. All measurements are in agreement
with the SM predictions above. Measurements and predictions for
Tevatron and LHC are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:ttxs} as a function
of the center--of--mass energy $\sqrt{s}$.

    scale, PDFs and the strong coupling. The measurements and the
    theory calculation is quoted at $m_t=172.5 \GeV$.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Decay}
\label{sec:topdecay}

The top quark has an extremely short lifetime of $5\times{}10^{-25}$
s. Therefore decay occurs before hadronization can take place, and the
decay products carry all of the information about \mbox{4--momentum} and spin
of the original particle.
The top quark decays in almost all cases via electroweak
interaction into a $b$ quark and a $W$ boson that,
in turn, decays either leptonically, into a charged lepton and the corresponding
antineutrino, or hadronically into a quark--antiquark pair. Thus the
final states corresponding to a \ttbar{} pair can be classified in
three categories, based on the decays of the two $W$ bosons
originating from the decays of the top and the antitop quarks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fully--hadronic final state: both $W$ bosons decay into quarks,
  leading to a \ttbar{} final state with six quarks.
\item Semileptonic final state: one $W$ boson decays into quarks,
  while the other decays leptonically, leading to a final state with
  four quarks, one lepton and one neutrino, also referred to as
  \ljets{} final state.
\item Dileptonic final state: both $W$ bosons decay leptonically,
  leading to a final state with two $b$ quarks, two leptons and two
  neutrinos. 
\end{itemize}
Given that the $W$ boson hadronic branching ratio is
$\sim67\%$, the full hadronic and semileptonic final states occur
$\sim45\%$ and $\sim44\%$ of the times, respectively, while the
dileptonic decay has the remaining $\sim11\%$ probability. In this
dissertation, the semileptonic final state to electron ($\ejets{}$)
and muon ($\mujets$) is considered, with a branching ratio of about
30\%.

\subsection{Properties}
\label{sec:topprop}

The properties of the top quark have been studied in detail at hadron
collider experiments over the last two decades, although the most
precise measurements have only become available over the last two
years following the analysis of the full Tevatron dataset ($\sim10
\ifb$ at $\sqrt{s}=1.97\TeV{}$) and the
high--statistics samples provided by the LHC ($\sim5\ifb$ at
\seventev{} and $\sim20\ifb$ at \eighttev{}). 
The combination of Tevatron and LHC results
brought the precision on the top mass measurement well below $1 \GeV{}$
with $m_t=173.3\pm{}0.8 \GeV{}$~\cite{topmass}.

The study of the top quark decay has allowed the investigation of the structure of the
electroweak $Wtb$--vertex by measuring the $W$ boson
helicity~\cite{Khachatryan:2014vma} and
polarization~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2013-033}.
The $Wtb$ coupling is also probed through measurements of the single
top quark cross section at Tevatron and LHC~\cite{Aad:2014fwa}.
The couplings with neutral vector bosons are important parameters of the SM
and are studied at LHC by measuring the \ttbar{} production in
association with a $Z$ boson~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2014-038} or a
photon~\cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-13-011}. Of particular interest is also the
\ttbar{} production in association with a Higgs boson, which has not
been observed yet.

Since the top quark does not form bound hadronic states due to its
short lifetime, it is the only quark whose spin properties, which are usually
concealed by hadronization, can be measured. The final state
particles in the decay carry information about the top quark spin;
therefore, it's possible to measure the top polarization and the spin
correlation of the top quark
pair~\cite{Aad:2013ksa,Aad:2014pwa,Chatrchyan:2013wua}. At the current
precision, these quantities have been found to be consistent with the SM
predictions. 

Kinematic properties of the \ttbar{} production, such as the
differential cross sections as a function of the \ttbar{} invariant
mass (\mtt{}) and transverse momentum (\pttt{}), have undergone a
detail scrutiny with precise measurements
(e.g. Ref.~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2014-057}).
In addition, searches for new physics
decay modes involving new particles, such as a charged Higgs in $t\to
H^+b$, or flavor changing neutral currents, such as $t\to \gamma q$,
$t\to Z q$ or $t\to H q$, are ongoing.
No sign of new particles in top quark production or decay have been
found so far.

\section{Charge asymmetry in top quark pair production}
\label{sec:topca}

As discussed in the previous section, most of the measurements in the
top quark sector have yielded results compatible with SM predictions.
The only exception was the measurement of the {\it forward--backward}
(FB) asymmetry in the production of \ttbar{} pairs in \ppbar{}
collisions at the Tevatron. In this section, we will discuss the
source of the forward--backward asymmetry in \ttbar{} production
within the SM, present a summary of Tevatron results, illustrate the
relevant observables at the LHC, and discuss possible contributions to
the asymmetry beyond the SM.

\subsection{Asymmetry in the SM}
\label{sec:smca}

The definition of a forward--backward asymmetry in the
\ttbar{} rest frame is the asymmetry in the distribution of the angle
$\theta_t$ between the outgoing top quark and the incoming quark
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:cmdiagram}):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:afbcostheta}
\afb{}=\frac{N(\cos\theta_t>0)-N(\cos\theta_t<0)}{N(\cos\theta_t>0)+N(\cos\theta_t<0)}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the asymmetry is defined only for \mbox{$\qqbar{}\to\ttbar{}$}
events, as it is not possible to define a direction of reference for
$gg\to\ttbar{}$ events, which are intrinsically symmetric.
\begin{figure}[!htb]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{figures/theory/cmdiagram}
  \caption{A representation of the $\qqbar{}\to\ttbar{}$ process in the
    center--of--mass frame. The top quark $t$ is produced at an angle
    $\theta_t$ with respect to the direction of the incoming quark
    $q$. For symmetric production the top quark is produced
    isotropically, while for a positive (negative) asymmetry, positive
    (negative) values of $\cos\theta_t$ are favored.} 
  \label{fig:cmdiagram}
\end{figure}

From Eq.~\ref{eq:afbcostheta} it follows that a non--zero asymmetry
appears if the angular differential cross section includes
non--vanishing terms with odd powers in $\cos\theta_t$.
The dominant contribution to the SM charge asymmetry originates from
the QCD \mbox{$\qqbar{}\to\ttbar{}+X$} production. Specifically, it originates from the
interference between the Born amplitude for \mbox{$\qqbar{}\to\ttbar{}$} and
its one--loop box correction, and from the interference between initial-- and final--state radiation (ISR, FSR) in \mbox{$\qqbar{}\to{}\ttbar{}g$}
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:asymdiagrams}). The terms of the angular differential cross section
$d\sigma_{\qqbar{}\to{}\ttbar{}}/d\cos\theta_t$ corresponding to these
interferences are antisymmetric for the exchange of top and antitop
quark momenta~\cite{Kuhn:1998kw}. In particular, considering the
definition in Eq.~\ref{eq:afbcostheta}, the Born--box interference
generates a positive asymmetry, while the ISR--FSR interference
generates a negative asymmetry.
The overall asymmetry depends on the fractional contributions of the two
sets of diagrams. Since the emission of ISR--FSR radiation correlates
with the transverse momentum \pttt{} of the \ttbar{} pair, for
$\pttt{}\lesssim{}25\GeV{}$ the asymmetry is positive, while for
$\pttt{}\gtrsim{}25\GeV{}$ is negative. The overall effect is a
positive asymmetry.

    interference of initial state (c) and final state (d) gluon
    radiation diagrams}
  \label{fig:asymdiagrams}
\end{figure}

Charge asymmetric contributions also arise from the interference of
the QCD \mbox{$\qqbar{}\to{}\ttbar{}$} diagrams in
Fig.~\ref{fig:asymdiagrams} with the QED analogous where a gluon is
replaced by a photon~\cite{Hollik:2011ps}. The size of the QED
corrections to the QCD asymmetric cross section depends on the
relative importance of \uubar{} and \ddbar{} annihilations, due to the
difference in electric charge.
In \ppbar{} collisions (Tevatron) the QED contribution is estimated to
be $\approx{}18\%$, while at LHC $pp$ collisions, with larger relative
importance of $\ddbar{}\to\ttbar{}$, it accounts for approximately $13\%$ of the
asymmetry~\cite{Kuhn:2011ri}.
Analogous contributions from weak interactions constitute only a
$\approx{}1\%$ correction at Tevatron and are negligible at LHC due to
the smallness of the weak coupling.

The asymmetry definition in Eq.~\ref{eq:afbcostheta} can be
generalized as the ratio between the asymmetric contribution
$\sigma_A$ to the cross section and the symmetric one $\sigma_S$:
\begin{equation}
  A_{QCD} = \frac{\sigma_A}{\sigma_S} = 
  \frac{\alpha_S^3\sigma_A^{(1)}+\alpha_S^4\sigma_A^{(2)}+\cdots{}}
  {\alpha_S^2\sigma_S^{(0)}+\alpha_S^3\sigma_S^{(1)}+\cdots{}}.
\end{equation}
Because the asymmetry vanishes at the tree level in the SM, a
consistent fixed-order expansion at LO in perturbation theory involves the
numerator computed at NLO and the denominator computed at LO:
\begin{equation}
  A_{QCD}^{(0)}=\frac{\alpha_S\sigma_A^{(1)}}{\sigma_S^{(0)}}.
\end{equation}
Until recently, predictions have thus been computed including the
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ QCD contribution and the mixed
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2\alpha)$ QCD-QED and QCD-weak corrections
discussed above. However, NLO QCD calculations have just become available with
preliminary predictions for \afb{}~\cite{mitov}, and predictions for
\ac{} expected in the very near future.

\subsection{\afb{} in \ppbar{} collisions}

The $\cos\theta_t$ quantity would be the fundamental observable to
measure the asymmetry in \ttbar{} production, but the direction of the
incoming quark is not directly accessible at experiments. However, at
Tevatron \ppbar{} collisions, the quark is provided by the proton with
very high probability ($\gtrsim{}99\%$ at $\sqrt{s}=1.96\TeV{}$);
therefore the top quark rapidity\footnote{The rapidity of a particle
  at colliders is given by $y=\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{E+p_z}{E-p_z}\right)$,
  where $E$ is the energy of the particle and $p_z$ the component of
  its momentum along the beam axis $z$.} $y$ with respect to the
proton beam direction can be used to distinguish between {\it forward}
and {\it backward} production with high efficiency.
The asymmetry \afb{} is then re--defined in terms of the rapidity $y$
of the top and antitop quarks in the laboratory frame: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:afb}
\afb{}=\frac{N(\Delta{}y>0)-N(\Delta{}y<0)}{N(\Delta{}y>0)+N(\Delta{}y<0)},
\end{equation}
with $\Delta{}y=y_t - y_{\bar{t}}$ and $N$ number of events.

The first precise measurements of \afb, using half
of the Tevatron Run II dataset, showed large discrepancies between
data and theory ($\gtrsim 3\sigma$).
At present, when the full Tevatron dataset has been analyzed, the
discrepancies have been reduced with respect to previous results. The
CDF collaboration reports \mbox{$\afb=0.164\pm0.045$}~\cite{Aaltonen:2012it},
corresponding to a $1.7\sigma$ excess over the SM prediction \mbox{$\afb{} =
0.088\pm{}0.006$}~\cite{Bernreuther:2012sx}, whereas the \dzero{} collaboration
finds agreement within $1\sigma$ with
\mbox{$\afb{}=0.106\pm0.030$}~\cite{Abazov:2014cca}. However, as
already discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:introduction}, the \afb{} spectrum as a
function of the \ttbar{} invariant mass \mtt{} still shows tantalizing discrepancies with
respect to the theoretical prediction (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cdfafb}).

\end{figure}

At the time work on this dissertation began, the discrepancy between
Tevatron data and the SM prediction was at its maximum,
with an excess over three standard deviations reported by the CDF
collaboration in the measurement of \afb{} at high \ttbar{} invariant
mass $\mtt{}>450\GeV{}$, using half of the total dataset. This anomaly
triggered a intense activity, both in developing new physics models
(summarized in Sec.~\ref{sec:bsmca})
that could explain the anomaly in \ttbar{} production, and in
calculating more precise and accurate SM predictions. The result also
motivated studies of the \ttbar{} production phenomenology aiming at
identifying other observables where anomalies might appear if the
Tevatron asymmetry were indeed a sign of new physics. Among these, the
charge asymmetry at the LHC is one of the best candidates. 

\subsection{\ac{} in $pp$ collisions}

In $pp$ collisions the incoming quark has the same probability to be provided by
either proton beam; thus a forward--backward asymmetry with respect to
a fixed direction, such as the one defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:afb},
vanishes due to the symmetry of the initial state. However, valence
quarks are more likely to participate in the interaction than sea
quarks and carry, on average, a larger fraction of momentum than sea
anti-quarks. Therefore, in the laboratory frame, the direction of
flight of the \ttbar{} system is likely to be the same as of the
incoming quark. In this scenario, a forward top quark in the \ttbar{}
center--of--mass frame has on average a larger absolute rapidity
$|y|$, in the laboratory frame, than the backward antiquark (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:rapidities}).
Therefore, a {\it forward-central} charge asymmetry \ac{} can be defined:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ac}
\ac{}=\frac{N(\Delta{}|y|>0)-N(\Delta{}|y|<0)}{N(\Delta{}|y|>0)+N(\Delta{}|y|<0)},
\end{equation}
with $\Delta{}|y|=|y_t| - |y_{\bar{t}}|$.
Such definition, in the following often referred to as {\it charge
  asymmetry}, allows probing the asymmetry in \ttbar{} production at
the LHC. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

  \caption{Not to scale rapidity distributions of top
    quarks and antiquark at Tevatron (left) and LHC (right). The
    asymmetric initial state at Tevatron provides a preferential
    direction, resulting in a forward--backward asymmetry, while the
    momentum imbalance between quark and antiquark at LHC allows to
    define a central--forward asymmetry~\ref{Rodrigo:2012as}.} 
  \label{fig:rapidities}
\end{figure}

The SM predictions for the LHC asymmetry are $\ac{}=0.0123\pm{}0.0005$
and $\ac{}=0.0111\pm0.0005$, at \seventev{} and \eighttev{}
respectively~\cite{Bernreuther:2012sx}.  
The SM prediction for \ac{} is one order of magnitude smaller than for
\afb{} because of two effects. First, the symmetric $gg\to\ttbar{}+X$
process is dominant at the LHC, accounting for $85\%$ of the total
cross section, as opposed to the $15\%$ at the Tevatron. This process
contributes exclusively to the denominator in Eq.~\ref{eq:afb}
and~\ref{eq:ac}, diluting the asymmetric \mbox{$\qqbar{}\to\ttbar{}$}
production. In addition, the probability that the anti-quark carries a
larger fraction of momentum than the quark -- in which case the
assumption that the \ttbar{} system is boosted in the direction of the
incoming quark is invalid -- is not negligible, and leads to a further
dilution of the asymmetry. The impact of both dilutions can be reduced
by applying a minimum requirement on the $z$-component of the \ttbar{}
system velocity \betatt{}~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2011cp}. Due to the
average momentum imbalance between quark and antiquark, in \qqbar{}
annihilation the \ttbar{} system is often produced with a large longitudinal
momentum. Figure~\ref{fig:qqbarfrac} shows how the relative importance
of the \qqbar{} process increases with the minimum requirement on \betatt{}.

\subsection{Charge asymmetry in beyond--SM scenarios}
\label{sec:bsmca}

An appealing possibility is that the discrepancies between the
experimental results and the SM predictions for \afb{} are a signal of
new physics in \ttbar{} production. In the last few years various
extensions of the SM have been proposed to explain the excess of the
measured \afb{}. The interference of the LO new physics diagram (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:npdiag}) is the mechanism originating the asymmetric
contribution from new physics.
The parameters of the models are chosen to be compatible with the \ttbar{}
cross section measurements, and they are required to fit within the
constraints from flavor physics and other electroweak precision
tests. However, a relatively wide range of asymmetries can be
predicted. 
\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{figures/theory/axigluon} 
  \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{figures/theory/zprime} 
  \caption{Tree--level \ttbar{} production for a s--channel
    color--octet (left) and for a t--channel Z' boson (right).} 
  \label{fig:npdiag}
\end{figure}

The following models have been studied in
detail by theorists with a focus on their impact on the charge
asymmetry in \ttbar{} production~\cite{Aguilar-Saavedra:2014kpa}:

{\em Color-octet vector $G$}. Exchanged in the $s$ channel via
flavor-diagonal couplings, it gives 
an amplitude that interferes with the SM $\qqbar\to\ttbar$ Born diagram. The
corresponding contribution to the charge asymmetry in
\mbox{$\qqbar{}\to\ttbar{}$} is proportional to the product of axial
couplings with light and top quarks $g_A^{u,d}g_A^t$. Depending on the
relative sign of the couplings and on the mass $M_G$, the contribution
to the asymmetry can be positive or negative. 

{\em Neutral $Z'$ boson}. It contributes to the $\uubar{}\to\ttbar{}$
process in a flavor--changing $t$ channel. A negative asymmetry
is generated by the interference with the SM $\qqbar\to\ttbar$ Born
diagram; therefore higher--order corrections are required to fit the
Tevatron excess. However such tuning of the model is disfavored by
measurements of other observables, such as the search for same--sign
top quark pairs.

{\em Charged $W'$ boson}. This gauge boson couples to right-handed
quarks and contributes in the $t$ channel to the partonic process
$\ddbar{}\to\ttbar{}$. Larger couplings are needed to compensate the
lower \ddbar{} luminosity. This field also produces negative
contributions to the asymmetry, so it is disfavored by current measurements.

{\em Scalar isodoublet $\phi$}.
Exchanged in the $t$ channel with a flavor--changing coupling, it gives
a positive contribution to the asymmetry via the interference with the
tree--level process. For small masses, an asymmetry consistent with the
\afb{} results can be obtained with relatively small couplings.

{\em Color-triplet scalar $\omega$}.
With charge $4e/3$, it appears only in the flavor--changing $u$
channel of the $\uubar{}\to\ttbar{}$ process. The leading--order
contribution to the asymmetry is negative, so large couplings are
required to have large higher--order corrections. Consequently,
cancellations of large leading--order effects must occur to accomodate
current measurements.

{\em Color-sextet scalar $\Omega$}.
Similar to the $\omega$ above, it also has charge $4e/3$ and therefore
contributes in the $u$--channel diagram. However, with a positive
asymmetry, it can easily fit the experimental results.

In all the models, the mass of the new particle and the couplings are
free parameters which can be tuned to generate asymmetries of
different size. The range of allowed \ac{} and \afb{} values for each
new physics model are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bsmmodels}. Depending on
the features of the model, the asymmetries show different dependence
on the \ttbar{} invariant mass. Therefore experimental input on this
dependence is valuable for model discrimination.
