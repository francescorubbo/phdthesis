\section{The Standard Model}
\label{sec:theSM}

The Standard Model (SM) is a quantum field theory describing the
interactions between the elementary constituents of matter through the
fundamental forces.
The elementary particles, three leptons, three neutrinos and six
quarks, are fermions categorized in three families. For each particle
there exist an antiparticle with same mass and opposite quantum
numbers for a total of 24 particles.
All particles carry a weak charge and interact with
the weak force carriers $W$ and $Z$. All of the particles, except for
neutrinos, are electrically charged and interact with the
electromagnetic force, mediated by $\gamma$. Only the quarks have a
color charge and undergo strong force interactions with {\it gluons}.  
Table~\ref{tab:smparticles} shows the elementary particles and
the fundamental force carriers of the Standard Model.

The theory describing the particle interactions is structured
according to the gauge group $SU(3)_C\times{}SU(2)_L\times{}U(1)_Y$. The three
terms represent the fundamental symmetries corresponding to the forces describing the
interaction of particles: $SU(3)_C$ is the {\it color} ($C$) symmetry corresponding
to the strong force; $SU(2)_L\times{}U(1)_Y$ is the spontaneously
broken symmetry with respect to the {\it isospin} ($L$)
and {\it hypercharge} ($Y$) gauge groups.
The SM is then the combination of two theories: the {\it Quantum
  Chromodynamics} (QCD) lagrangian, which describes the strong
interaction arising from the $SU(3)$ color symmetry, and the {\it
  Electroweak} lagrangian, which accounts for the electroweak
interactions corresponding to the $SU(2)\times{}U(1)$ isospin and
hypercharge symmetries.
\begin{equation}
\lagr{}_{SM} = \lagr{}_{SU(3)} + \lagr{}_{SU(2)\times{}U(1)}
= \lagr{}_{SU(3)}^{Gauge} + \lagr{}_{SU(3)}^{Matter} 
+ \lagr{}_{SU(2)\times{}U(1)}^{Gauge} + \lagr{}_{SU(2)\times{}U(1)}^{Matter}
+ \lagr{}_{SU(2)\times{}U(1)}^{Higgs} +
\lagr{}_{SU(2)\times{}U(1)}^{Yukawa}
\phantom{.}
\end{equation}
The $\lagr{}^{Gauge}$ terms describe the dynamics of the gauge fields:
the gluons in QCD, and the $W$, $Z$ and $\gamma$ boson in the
electroweak theory. The $\lagr{}^{Matter}$ terms describe the
interaction of particles with the gauge fields.

\section{The top quark}
\label{sec:topquark}

The top quark was discovered in 1995 at the Tevatron by the
CDF~\cite{topcdf} and \dzero{}~\cite{topd0} collaborations. With a
mass of ???\cite{topmass} it is the heaviest elementary particle
observed so far.

\subsection{Pair production at hadron colliders}
\label{sec:topprod}

At hadron colliders, top quarks are mainly produced in pairs through QCD
processes. Interactions between the parton constituents of the
colliding hadrons (protons or antiprotons) participate in a hard
scattering process and produce a top quark and an antitop quark. The
leading production modes are: {\it gluon--gluon fusion} and {\it
  quark--antiquark annihilation}. The leading order Feynman diagrams
for these two processes are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ttbarprod}. The
following discussion focus on the top quark pair production in proton
collisions, however similar considerations apply to the case of
proton-antiproton collisions.

\begin{figure}[!htb]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{figures/theory/}
  \caption{Leading order diagrams for QCD top quark pair production
    via gluon--gluon fusion (top) and quark--antiquark annihilation (bottom).}
  \label{fig:ttbarprod}
\end{figure}

Due to the composite nature of protons, most of the
collisions involve only soft (i.e. long distance) interactions of the
constituent quarks and gluons. Such interactions cannot be described
with perturbative QCD, because $\alpha_s$ is large due to the small
momentum exchange. In some collisions, however, in addition to the
long distance parton interactions, two quarks or two gluons undergo a
hard (i.e. short distance) scattering where a top quark pair is produced.
The {\it factorization principle}~\cite{factorprinciple} states that
the perturbative QCD description of this hard process is possible by
factorizing the long distance effects into functions $f$ describing the
proton structure. Thus the cross section for top quark pair
production in a collision of two protons with momenta $P_1$ and $P_2$
can be written as: 
\begin{equation}
  \sigma(p(P_1)+p(P_2)\to\ttbar{}+{\rm X})
  = 
  \int_0^1{\rm d}x_1
  ~\int_0^1{\rm d}x_2
  ~\sum_f~ f_f(x_1) f_f(x_2)
  \cdot{}\hat{\sigma}(q_f(x_1P_1)+\bar{q}_f(x_2P_2)\to\ttbar{}+{\rm
    X})
  \phantom{,}
  \label{eq:ttbarxs}
\end{equation}
where the sum runs over all type of partons, and $x_{1,2}$ are the
fractions of proton momentum carried by the constituents participating
in the hard interaction. 

The {\it parton distribution functions} (PDFs) $f_f(x,\factscale{})$
represent the probability density for a parton of a type $i$ to carry
a fraction of hadron momentum $x$. The {\it factorization scale}
\factscale{} is set arbitrarily and defines the distinction between
short and long distance interactions based on the transferred momentum
$Q^2$. An additional renormalization scale \renormscale{} accounts for higher
order corrections. For calculations and simulations, both scales are
set to the typical transferred momentum of the process studied. In the case of
\ttbar{} production the scale is chosen to be equal to the top mass $m_t$.
  
The PDFs cannot be computed in perturbation theory; instead, they are
measured in deep inelastic scattering experiments and at hadron colliders.
For the measurements presented in this thesis, the PDF estimations
provided by the CTEQ~\cite{cteq}, MSTW~\cite{mstw}, CT10~\cite{ct10}
and NNPDF~\cite{nnpdf} collaborations are used. Fig.~\ref{fig:pdfs}
shows the PDFs of valence quarks, gluons and sea quarks for two values
of transferred momentum $Q^2$ at which the proton is probed. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{figures/theory/mstw2008nnlo68cl_allpdfs}
  \caption{MSTW parton distribution functions~\cite{ct10} for gluons
    and quarks at $Q^2=10\GeV{}$ (left) and $Q^2=10\TeV{}$ (right).}
  \label{fig:pdfs}
\end{figure}

The typical fraction of momentum $x$ carried by each of the colliding
partons in order to produce a top quark pair is defined by the
relationship
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{x_1x_2s}\geq{}2m_t\phantom{.}
\end{equation}
Therefore, assuming the partons carry a similar fraction of momentum
$x_1\simeq{}x_2\simeq{}x$:
\begin{equation}
x=\frac{2m_t}{\sqrt{s}}
\phantom{.}
\end{equation}
This corresponds to a typical value of $x\approx{}0.05$ at the LHC for
a center-of-mass energy \seventev{} and \eighttev{}. As shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:pdfs} the probability of gluon collisions is
significantly larger than for any other parton in the corresponding
range of $x$. Thus the production of top quark pairs at the LHC is
dominated by the gluon fusion process ($\approx{}90\%$). On the
contrary, at the Tevatron, the typical value of $x\approx{}0.2$ makes
the valence quark-antiquark annihilation the prevalent \ttbar{}
production mode.

The total \ttbar{} production cross section at the LHC is calculated
at next-to-next-to leading order in
QCD~\cite{ttxs1,ttxs2,ttxs3,ttxs4,ttxs5,ttxs6,ttxs7} to be
$177.31^{+10.1}_{-10.8}$ pb at \seventev{} and
$252.89^{+13.30}_{-14.52}$ pb at \eighttev{}, for a top quark mass of
$172.5 \GeV{}$. Measurements have been performed by both ATLAS and CMS
collaborations, yielding a combine value of $173.3\pm10.1$ pb at
\seventev{}~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2012-134,CMS-PAS-TOP-12-003}. Preliminary
measurements at \eighttev{} yield $\sigma_{\ttbar{}}=242\pm{}9$ pb
(ATLAS)~\cite{Aad:2014kva} and $\sigma_{\ttbar{}}=239\pm{}13$ pb
(CMS)~\cite{Chatrchyan:2013faa}. All measurements are in agreement
with the SM predictions above.

\subsection{Decay}
\label{sec:topdecay}

The top quark has an extremely short lifetime, $5\times{}10^{-25}$
s, therefore hadronization does not take place and the decay products
carry the whole information about 4--momentum and spin of the original
particle.
The top quark decays in almost all cases via electroweak
charged current interaction into a $b$ quark and a $W$ boson, which
decays either leptonically, into a charged lepton and the corresponding
antineutrino, or hadronically into a quark--antiquark pair. Thus the
final states corresponding to a \ttbar{} pair can be classified in
three categories, based on the decays of the two $W$ bosons
originating from the decays of the top and the antitop quarks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Full hadronic final state: both $W$ bosons decay into quarks,
  leading to a \ttbar{} final state with six quarks.
\item Semileptonic final state: one $W$ boson decays into quarks,
  while the other decays leptonically, leading to a final state with
  four quarks, one lepton and one neutrino.
\item Dileptonic final state: both $W$ bosons decay leptonically,
  leading to a final state with two $b$ quarks, two leptons and two
  neutrinos. 
\end{itemize}
Given that the $W$ boson hadronic branching ratio is
$\approx{}2/3$, the full hadronic and semileptonic final states occur
$4$ out of $9$ times each, while the dileptonic decay has the
remaining $1/9$ probability.  

\subsection{Properties}
\label{sec:topdecay}

The properties of the top quark have been studied in details at hadron
collider experiments. The combination of Tevatron and LHC results
brought the precision on the top mass measurement well below $1 \GeV{}$
with $m_t=173.3\pm{}0.8 \GeV{}$~\cite{topmass}.
An exotic electric charge of $4e/3$ for the top quark, for which the
SM predicts a $2e/3$ charge, has been excluded by measurements at both
Tevatron experiments~\cite{Abazov:2006vd,Aaltonen:2010js} and at the
ATLAS experiment~\cite{Aad:2013uza}.
Since the top quark does not form bound hadronic states due to its
small lifetime, it provides the unique opportunity to measure quark
properties that are usually concealed by hadronization. The final state
particles in the decay carry information about the top quark spin,
therefore, it's possible to measure the top polarization and the spin
correlation of the top quark pair. At the current precision, these
quantities have been found to be compatible with the SM predictions.


\section{Charge Asymmetry in Top Quark Pair Production}
\label{sec:topca}

Most of the measurements of the top quark properties are compatible
with SM predictions, a notable exception is the {\it forward-backward}
(FB) asymmetry in the production of \ttbar{} pairs in \ppbar{}
collisions at the Tevatron. 
The asymmetry \afb{} is defined in terms of the rapidity $y$ of the top and
antitop quarks in the laboratory frame\footnote{The rapidity of a
  particle at colliders is given by $y=\frac{1}{2}log\frac{E+p_z}{E-p_z}$, where
  $E$ is the energy of the particle and $p_z$ the component of its
  momentum along the beam axis $z$.}: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:afb}
\afb{}=\frac{N(\Delta{}y>0)-N(\Delta{}y<0)}{N(\Delta{}y>0)+N(\Delta{}y<0)}
\phantom{,}
\end{equation}
with $\Delta{}y=y_t - y_{\bar{t}}$ and $N$ number of events.
At present, when the full Tevatron dataset has been analyzed, the
discrepancies have been reduced with respect to previous results. The
CDF collaboration reports a $1.7\sigma$ excess over the SM
prediction~\cite{Aaltonen:2012it}, whereas the \dzero{} collaboration
finds agreement within $1\sigma$~\cite{Abazov:2014cca}.

At the time when this thesis work began, a discrepancy between
experimental data and the SM prediction over three standard deviations
was found in a CDF measurement of \afb{} at high \ttbar{} invariant
mass $\mtt{}>450\GeV{}$, using half of the total dataset. This anomaly
motivated intense research in model building -- invoking new physics
in \ttbar{} production as the explanation for the anomaly -- as well
as the update of the SM calculations. Since then, it also fostered the
theoretical and experimental search of other anomalies in \ttbar{}
production, which might appear if the Tevatron asymmetry were indeed a
sign of new physics. Among the latter, the charge asymmetry at the LHC
has a prominent role. in $pp$ collisions a FB asymmetry with a fixed
$z$ axis, such as the one defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:afb}, vanishes due to
the symmetry of the initial state. However a {\it forward-central} charge
asymmetry \ac{} can be defined, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ac}
\ac{}=\frac{N(\Delta{}|y|>0)-N(\Delta{}|y|<0)}{N(\Delta{}|y|>0)+N(\Delta{}|y|<0)}
\phantom{,}
\end{equation}
with $\Delta{}|y|=|y_t| - |y_{\bar{t}}|$, which is a complementary
probe of asymmetric \ttbar{} production.

\subsection{SM Charge Asymmetry}
\label{sec:qcdca}

The dominant contribution to the SM charge asymmetry originates from
the QCD $\qqbar{}\to\ttbar{}+X$ production. Specifically, it originates from the
interference between the Born amplitude for $\qqbar{}\to\ttbar{}$ and
its one--loop box correction, and the one between initial and final
state radiation (ISR, FSR) in $\qqbar{}\to{}\ttbar{}g$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:asymdiagrams}). The terms of the angular differential cross section
$d\sigma_{\qqbar{}\to{}\ttbar{}}/\mathrm{d}cos\theta$ (where $\theta$
is the angle between the outgoing top quark and the incoming quark)
corresponding to these interferences are antisymmetric for the
exchange of top and antitop quark momenta~\ref{Kuhn:1998kw}. In
particular, considering the definitions in Eq.~\ref{eq:afb}
and~\ref{eq:ac}, Born-box interference generates a positive asymmetry,
while the ISR-FSR interference generates a negative asymmetry.
The relative size of the two contributions depends on the transverse
momentum of the \ttbar{} system \pttt{}. For
$\pttt{}\lesssim{}25\GeV{}$ the asymmetry is positive, while for
$\pttt{}\gtrsim{}25\GeV{}$ is negative. The overall effect is a
positive asymmetry.

    interference of initial state (c) and final state (d) gluon
    radiation diagrams}
  \label{fig:asymdiagrams}
\end{figure}

Charge asymmetric contributions also arise from the interference of
the QCD $\qqbar{}\to{}\ttbar{}$ diagrams in
Fig.~\ref{fig:asymdiagrams} with the QED analogous where a gluon is
replaced by a photon. The size of the QED corrections to the QCD
asymmetric cross section depend on the relative importance of \uubar{}
and \ddbar{} annihilations, due to the difference in electric charge.
At \ppbar{} collisions (Tevatron) the QED contribution is estimated to
be $\approx{}18\%$, while at LHC $pp$ collisions, with larger relative
\ddbar{} importance, it accounts for approximately $13\%$ of the
asymmetry~\cite{Kuhn:2011ri}.
Analogous contributions from weak interactions, where a $Z$ boson is
replaced to the photon, constitute a $\approx{}1\%$ correction at
Tevatron and are negligible at LHC due to the smallness of the
weak coupling.

The asymmetry definition in Eq.~\ref{eq:afb} and~\ref{eq:ac} can be
generalized as the ratio between the asymmetric contribution
$\sigma_A$ to the cross section and the symmetric one $\sigma_S$:
\begin{equation}
  A_{QCD} = \frac{\sigma_A}{\sigma_S} = 
  \frac{\alpha_S^3\sigma_A^{(1)}+\alpha_S^4\sigma_A^{(2)}+\cdots{}}
  {\alpha_S^2\sigma_S^{(0)}+\alpha_S^3\sigma_S^{(1)}+\cdots{}}
\end{equation}
Because the asymmetry vanishes at the tree level in the SM, a
consistent fixed-order expansion at LO in perturbation theory involves the
numerator at NLO and the denominator at LO:
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_SA_{QCD}^{(0)}=\frac{\alpha_S\sigma_A^{(1)}}{\sigma_S^{(0)}}
\end{equation}
Predictions of \afb{} for Tevatron and \ac{} for LHC have thus been
computed including the $\mathcal{0}(\alpha_s^3)$
QCD contribution and the mixed $\mathcal{0}(\alpha_s^2\alpha)$ QCD-QED
and QCD-weak corrections discussed above. The SM forward-backward
asymmetry at \ppbar{} collision, evaluated at $\sqrt{s}=1.96\TeV{}$,
is $\afb{} = 0.088\pm{}0.006$, while the SM predictions for the LHC
asymmetry are, at \seventev{} and \eighttev{} respectively,
$\ac{}=0.0123\pm{}0.0005$ and
$\ac{}=0.0111\pm0.0005$~\cite{Bernreuther:2012sx}. 
The SM prediction for \ac{} is one order of magnitude smaller than for
\afb{} because of two effects. First, the symmetric $gg\to\ttbar{}+X$
process is dominant at the LHC, accounting for $80\%$ of the total
cross section, as opposed to the $15\%$ at the Tevatron. This process
contributes exclusively to the denominator in Eq.~\ref{eq:afb}
and~\ref{eq:ac}, diluting the asymmetric $\qqbar{}\to\ttbar{}$
production. In addition, the probability that the anti-quark carries a
larger fraction of momentum than the quark -- in which case the
assumption that the \ttbar{} system is boosted in the direction of the
incoming quark is voided -- is not negligible, and leads to a further
dilution of the asymmetry.
